# rOpenEpi: R Port of Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This package is the R port for the free and open source software [OpenEpi](https://www.openepi.com). [OpenEpi](https://www.openepi.com) provides statistics for counts and measurements in descriptive and analytic studies, stratified analysis with exact confidence limits, matched pair and person-time analysis, sample size and power calculations, random numbers, sensitivity, specificity and other evaluation statistics, R x C tables and chi-square for dose-response. The original software was written in JavaScript and HTML and was designed to be a serverless, browser-based application that can be used on any computer platform including smartphones. With the advent of Shiny in R, re-creating the [OpenEpi](https://www.openepi.com) browser-based application has become possible. This package translates the JavaScript calculator functions used in the original application into R and includes a Shiny application that uses these functions to replicate the original [OpenEpi](https://www.openepi.com) browser application.
