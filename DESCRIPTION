Description: This package is the R port for the free and open source software
    OpenEpi <https://www.openepi.com>. OpenEpi provides statistics for counts 
    and measurements in descriptive and analytic studies, stratified analysis 
    with exact confidence limits, matched pair and person-time analysis, sample 
    size and power calculations, random numbers, sensitivity, specificity and 
    other evaluation statistics, R x C tables and chi-square for dose-response.
    The original software was written in JavaScript and HTML and was designed
    to be a serverless, browser-based application that can be used on any
    computer platform including smartphones. With the advent of Shiny in R,
    re-creating the OpenEpi browser-based application has become possible. This
    package translates the JavaScript calculator functions used in the original
    application into R and includes a Shiny application that uses these
    functions to replicate the original OpenEpi browser application.
