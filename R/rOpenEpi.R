#' R Port of Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health
#'
#' This package is the R port for the free and open source software OpenEpi
#' <https://www.openepi.com>. OpenEpi provides statistics for counts and
#' measurements in descriptive and analytic studies, stratified analysis with
#' exact confidence limits, matched pair and person-time analysis, sample size
#' and power calculations, random numbers, sensitivity, specificity and other
#' evaluation statistics, R x C tables and chi-square for dose-response. The
#' original software was written in JavaScript and HTML and was designed to be
#' a serverless, browser-based application that can be used on any computer
#' platform including smartphones. With the advent of Shiny in R, re-creating
#' the OpenEpi browser-based application has become possible. This package
#' translates the JavaScript calculator functions used in the original
#' application into R and includes a Shiny application that uses these functions
#' to replicate the original OpenEpi browser application.
